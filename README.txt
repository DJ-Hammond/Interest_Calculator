About this Project:
This is a simple interest calculator which can calculate how much money a savings account would have after yearly compounding interest.  
The calculator uses the following formula:
A = P (1 + r)^t
A = Amount after interest accrues,
P = Principal amount,
r = Interest rate,
t = Number of years interest accrues


Installation Instructions:
This project does not need to be installed.  Download the repository zip folder and extract the contents to a folder.  
The calculator can be started by running the "interest_calculator.exe" file within the "interest_calculator" folder. 


Usage Instructions:
To start the program, run the "interest_calculator.exe" file.  For each calculation, you will need to enter a currency name, principal amount, interest rate, and number of years for interest to accrue.  After viewing the result, you can either continue or quit the program.

The currency name must only include letters and spaces.  You cannot use numbers or symbols in your currency name.

The principal amount must be a non-negative number.  You cannot include letters, spaces, or symbols other than a decimal point.  Do not include the currency name.

The interest rate must be a non-negative number.  You cannot include letters, spaces, or symbols other than a decimal point.  Do not include the percent sign (%).  Do not use decimal representation for your interest rate.  
Example: For an interest rate of 4.5%, enter 4.5 (do not enter 0.045).

The number of years must be a non-negative number.  You cannot include letters, spaces, or symbols other than a decimal point.  Do not include the word "years".  You may enter years with decimal values.

After entering these four required values, the calculator will display a message showing the balance of your account after interest accrues based on your inputs.  You will then be prompted to continue or quit.  To continue, enter Y (uppercase or lowercase).  Anything other than Y will cause the program to terminate.
